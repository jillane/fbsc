Website for Forres Bluefins Swimming Club

Hi,

I'm a rookie web developer, currently doing my Computing Hons and trying to learn as much as I can by playing around. :-)
My sons used to swim with the Bluefins which is a non-profit swimming club for kids, run completely by volunteers. 
I used to be the Treasurer and then the Gala Treasurer and I also maintained their old website. So as well
as recreating a website for them, I've gained loads of experience thanks to the club. This new website is my thanks to them.
