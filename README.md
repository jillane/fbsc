Website for Forres Bluefins Swimming Club

Hi, 
I'm a rookie web developer, currently doing my Computing Hons and trying to learn as much as I can by playing around. :-)
My sons used to swim with the Bluefins and I used to be both the Treasurer and then the Gala Treasurer so as well
as recreating a website for them, I've gained loads of experience thanks to the club. The website is my thanks to them.
